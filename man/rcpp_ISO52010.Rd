\usage{
rcpp_ISO52010(
  lat,
  lng,
  tz,
  t_shift,
  surfaceAzimuths,
  surfaceTilts,
  n_hour,
  n_day,
  G_dir,
  G_dif,

  interp_perez
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lat}{Latitude, in radians}

\item{lng}{Longitude, in radians}

\item{tz}{Time zone of the irradiance data, in hours. E.g. +1 for central European 
(UTC+1) time zones. Use 0, if data is recorded in UTC time.}

\item{t_shift}{Decimal hours to shift timestamps with. E.g. timestamp 12:00 usually refer to the
solar irradaince during time interval 11:00 - 12:00, then use t_shift = 0.5. 
If the timestamp 12:00 refer to interval 11:45 - 12:15, use t_shift = 0.0. 
If the timestamp 12:00 refer to interval 11:45 - 12:00, use t_shift = 0.125.}

\item{surfaceAzimuths}{Vector of surface azimuths, in radians}

\item{surfaceTilts}{Vector of surface tilts, in radians. Need to be same length as surfaceAzimuths}

\item{n_hour}{Vector representing the hour of the day for every time step (double 0-24)}

\item{n_day}{Vector representing the day of the year for every time step (integer 1-366)}

\item{G_dir}{Vector of direct normal irradiance, W/m2}

\item{G_dif}{Vector of diffuse horizontal irradiance, W/m2}

\item{albedo}{Vector of solar reflectivity of the ground, 0.2 can be used if actual conditions are unknown.}

\item{interp_perez}{Set to 0 to interpolate from the Parez table (clearness index    and    brightness coefficients). 
Set to 1 to use binned values, this follow the procedure of the ISO 52010-1:2017 standard.}
}
\value{
A matrix where first column holds the solar altitude for each time step,
from second column calculated total direct irradiances (I_tot_dir) for each surface are returned, 
and from column position 1 + "number of surfaces" total diffuse irradiances are returned
}
\description{
Calculate solar irradiance on a surface with arbitrary orientation and tilt
